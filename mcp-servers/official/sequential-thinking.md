## ⚙️ Configuration

### All Platforms (Same Config)

**Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Desktop / VS Code:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. **Debug Complex Code**
```
"This function isn't working. Think through what might be wrong."
```
AI systematically analyzes the problem step-by-step.

### 2. **Architecture Decisions**
```
"Should I use microservices or monolith for this project?"
```
AI weighs pros/cons, considers context, provides reasoned answer.

### 3. **Algorithm Design**
```
"Design an efficient algorithm for finding duplicates in a large dataset"
```
AI explores approaches, revises, optimizes.

### 4. **Code Review**
```
"Review this PR and identify potential issues"
```
AI thinks through edge cases, security, performance.

### 5. **Learning & Explanation**
```
"Explain how React hooks work, step by step"
```
AI breaks down complex topics clearly.

## 🎓 Before/After Examples

### Without Sequential Thinking
```
Q: "How do I optimize this slow query?"
A: "Add an index on the column."
```

### With Sequential Thinking
```
Q: "How do I optimize this slow query?"

AI Thinks:
1. First, identify the bottleneck - is it the WHERE clause?
2. Check if there's already an index... no
3. Consider if index will help... yes, filtering on user_id
4. But wait - is the table size the real issue?
5. Let me check query execution plan first...
6. Ah! The JOIN is the problem, not the WHERE
7. Should suggest composite index on join columns

A: "The slow query is due to the JOIN. Add a composite 
index on (user_id, created_at). This will speed up 
the join operation by 10-100x."
```

**See the difference?** Deep analysis vs quick guess.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI Not Using Sequential Thinking

**Try asking:**
```
"Think step-by-step about this problem..."
"Use sequential thinking to solve..."
"Break this down into steps..."
```

### Too Slow for Simple Tasks

**Ask specific questions** - AI uses it when needed.
