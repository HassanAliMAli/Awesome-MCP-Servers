## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Required MCP Servers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "${POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING}"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "${workspaceFolder}"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration

Ask your AI assistant:
```
"Connect to my PostgreSQL database and show me the schema"
```

AI will:
- Connect to your database
- List all tables and columns
- Show sample data
- Identify relationships

### 2. Query Generation

Ask:
```
"Show me the top 10 customers by total revenue this quarter"
```

AI will:
- Generate optimized SQL query
- Execute and fetch results
- Format output for readability
- Suggest visualizations

### 3. Statistical Analysis

Ask:
```
"Analyze the correlation between customer age and purchase frequency"
```

AI will:
- Generate statistical queries
- Calculate correlation coefficients
- Identify trends and patterns
- Provide insights

## üìä Machine Learning Workflows

### 1. Model Development

Ask:
```
"Create a Python script for customer churn prediction using scikit-learn"
```

AI will:
- Generate data preprocessing code
- Implement model training
- Add evaluation metrics
- Include visualization

### 2. Feature Engineering

Ask:
```
"Based on this dataset, what features would be most predictive for churn?"
```

AI will:
- Analyze data distributions
- Suggest feature transformations
- Identify interaction terms
- Recommend feature selection methods

### 3. Model Evaluation

Ask:
```
"Evaluate this model's performance and suggest improvements"
```

AI will:
- Calculate accuracy metrics
- Generate confusion matrix
- Analyze feature importance
- Suggest hyperparameter tuning

## üìà Advanced Analytics

### 1. Time Series Analysis

Ask:
```
"Analyze sales trends over the past year and forecast next quarter"
```

AI will:
- Generate time series queries
- Apply forecasting models
- Create trend visualizations
- Provide confidence intervals

### 2. A/B Testing Analysis

Ask:
```
"Analyze the results of our latest A/B test on checkout conversion"
```

AI will:
- Calculate statistical significance
- Generate conversion rates
- Create comparison charts
- Provide recommendations

### 3. Cohort Analysis

Ask:
```
"Perform cohort analysis on user retention by signup month"
```

AI will:
- Generate cohort queries
- Calculate retention rates
- Create retention matrices
- Identify retention patterns

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Data Context
```
"Remember that:
- Our database uses PostgreSQL
- Customer data is in the 'customers' table
- Sales data is in the 'transactions' table
- We're using Python 3.9 with pandas and scikit-learn"
```

### 2. Query Optimization
```
"For large datasets, always:
- Use LIMIT clauses for sampling
- Add appropriate indexes
- Avoid SELECT * queries
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze performance"
```

### 3. Result Interpretation
```
"When analyzing results:
- Always check for statistical significance
- Consider practical significance
- Look for confounding variables
- Validate assumptions"
```
