## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Project Setup

Ask your AI assistant:
```
"Create a new React + TypeScript project structure in the current directory"
```

AI will:
- Create directory structure
- Generate package.json
- Set up tsconfig.json
- Create src/ and public/ folders

### 2. Code Generation

Ask:
```
"Create a user authentication component with login form and validation"
```

AI will:
- Generate React component code
- Add form validation
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Suggest styling approaches

### 3. Code Review

Ask:
```
"Review this component and suggest improvements"
```

AI will:
- Check for best practices
- Identify potential bugs
- Suggest performance optimizations
- Recommend accessibility improvements

---

## üêõ Debugging & Testing

### Debugging Workflow

Ask:
```
"I'm getting this error: 'Cannot read property 'name' of undefined'. Help me debug."
```

AI will:
- Analyze the error message
- Search relevant files
- Suggest potential causes
- Provide fix recommendations

### Automated Testing

Ask:
```
"Create Playwright tests for the login flow"
```

AI will:
- Generate test scripts
- Set up test data
- Create assertions
- Handle edge cases

## üìà Advanced Workflows

### 1. Feature Development

Ask:
```
"Implement user profile editing with image upload"
```

AI will:
- Design component architecture
- Generate API integration code
- Handle file uploads
- Add error handling

### 2. Performance Optimization

Ask:
```
"Analyze this React app for performance issues"
```

AI will:
- Review component structure
- Identify re-render issues
- Suggest memoization strategies
- Recommend bundle optimization

### 3. Documentation

Ask:
```
"Create README.md for this project with setup instructions"
```

AI will:
- Generate comprehensive documentation
- Include setup steps
- Add usage examples
- Create troubleshooting section

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Context Management
```
"Remember that this project uses:
- React 18 with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for data fetching"
```

### 2. Code Consistency
```
"Follow the existing code style in this project:
- Use functional components
- Prefer arrow functions
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props"
```

### 3. Error Handling
```
"Always include try/catch blocks for API calls
and show user-friendly error messages"
```
