## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Workflow

### 1. Test Creation

Ask your AI assistant:
```
"Create Playwright tests for the user login flow"
```

AI will:
- Generate test scripts
- Set up test data
- Create assertions
- Handle edge cases

### 2. Test Execution

Ask:
```
"Run all tests in the e2e directory and report results"
```

AI will:
- Execute test suite
- Monitor progress
- Capture failures
- Generate reports

### 3. Bug Reporting

Ask:
```
"Create a GitHub issue for this test failure"
```

AI will:
- Analyze failure details
- Create structured issue
- Include reproduction steps
- Add relevant labels

---

## üß™ Test Types

### 1. End-to-End Testing

Ask:
```
"Create tests for the complete checkout process"
```

AI will:
- Navigate through full workflow
- Test happy path
- Include error scenarios
- Validate data persistence

### 2. UI Component Testing

Ask:
```
"Test the responsive behavior of this React component"
```

AI will:
- Test different screen sizes
- Verify layout changes
- Check interactive elements
- Validate accessibility

### 3. API Testing

Ask:
```
"Test the user authentication API endpoints"
```

AI will:
- Test success scenarios
- Validate error responses
- Check rate limiting
- Verify security measures

---

## üêõ Debugging Workflows

### 1. Failure Analysis

Ask:
```
"Analyze this test failure and suggest fixes"
```

AI will:
- Review failure logs
- Identify root cause
- Suggest code changes
- Provide verification steps

### 2. Performance Testing

Ask:
```
"Measure page load times and identify bottlenecks"
```

AI will:
- Run performance tests
- Analyze metrics
- Identify slow resources
- Suggest optimizations

### 3. Cross-Browser Testing

Ask:
```
"Test this feature across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari"
```

AI will:
- Run tests on multiple browsers
- Compare results
- Identify compatibility issues
- Document findings

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Test Data Management
```
"Remember that:
- Use realistic test data
- Clean up test artifacts
- Handle sensitive information
- Maintain test data consistency"
```

### 2. Test Coverage
```
"When writing tests:
- Cover happy path scenarios
- Include edge cases
- Test error conditions
- Validate user inputs"
```

### 3. Reporting Standards
```
"For test reports:
- Include clear pass/fail status
- Provide detailed failure information
- Add screenshots for UI issues
- Suggest next steps"
```
